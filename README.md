## Features

### Portfolio Management
- **Multiple Account Types**: Support for Traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k), Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, and HSA accounts
- **Employer Matching**: Configure employer match percentage and limits for 401(k) accounts
- **Individual Returns**: Set expected return rates per account
- **Contribution Growth**: Model salary increases affecting future contributions

### Retirement Projections
- **Accumulation Phase**: Project portfolio growth from now until retirement with compound interest and contributions
- **Withdrawal Phase**: Simulate retirement spending with tax-optimized withdrawal strategies
- **Social Security Integration**: Include Social Security benefits starting at your chosen age
- **Inflation Adjustment**: All projections account for inflation over time

### Tax-Optimized Withdrawals
The withdrawal algorithm follows a tax-efficient strategy:
1. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Mandatory withdrawals from traditional accounts starting at age 73
2. **Tax Bracket Optimization**: Fill lower tax brackets with traditional withdrawals
3. **Roth Withdrawals**: Tax-free withdrawals for remaining needs
4. **Taxable Account Withdrawals**: With capital gains tracking
5. **HSA**: Used last, tax-free for qualified medical expenses

### Tax Calculations

- Long-term capital gains rates with 0%/15%/20% brackets
- State tax rate configuration
- Standard deduction applied automatically
- Social Security taxation (85% taxable)

## How It Works

### Accumulation Phase
For each year until retirement:
1. Apply investment returns to existing balance
2. Add annual contribution (with employer match if applicable)
3. Grow contribution amount by contribution growth rate

### Withdrawal Phase
For each year of retirement:
1. Calculate Required Minimum Distribution (if age 73+)
2. Determine target spending (safe withdrawal rate + inflation)
3. Subtract Social Security income from spending need
4. Withdraw from accounts in tax-optimized order
5. Apply investment returns to remaining balance
6. Calculate federal and state taxes

### Key Assumptions
- Investment returns are applied annually
- Contributions are made at year-end
- RMDs follow the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
- Social Security benefits grow with inflation
- Tax brackets are 2024 values (not inflation-adjusted)

## Configuration

### Default Values
| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Current Age | 35 |
| Retirement Age | 65 |
| Life Expectancy | 90 |
| Inflation Rate | 3% |
| Safe Withdrawal Rate | 4% |
| Retirement Return Rate | 5% |
| Social Security Benefit | $30,000/year |
| Social Security Start Age | 67 |

### Account Defaults
| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Expected Return | 7% |
| Contribution Growth | 3% |

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all calculations:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Federal and state tax calculations
- Capital gains taxation
- RMD calculations
- Accumulation phase projections
- Withdrawal phase simulations
- Edge cases (zero balances, long retirements, etc.)
