## Features

### Multi-Country Support
The calculator supports retirement planning for both **United States** and **Canada**:

#### United States
- **Account Types**: Traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k), Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, HSA
- **Tax System**: Federal income tax brackets, state tax rates, capital gains rates
- **Benefits**: Social Security integration with configurable start age
- **RMDs**: Required Minimum Distributions starting at age 73

#### Canada
- **Account Types**: RRSP, TFSA, RRIF, LIRA, LIF, FHSA, Non-registered, Employer RRSP
- **Tax System**: Federal tax brackets, provincial tax rates by region
- **Benefits**: CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security)

Switching countries automatically resets accounts and profile to country-appropriate defaults.

### Portfolio Management

- **Employer Matching**: Configure employer match percentage and limits for 401(k)/RRSP accounts
- **Individual Returns**: Set expected return rates per account
- **Contribution Growth**: Model salary increases affecting future contributions
- **Configurable Withdrawal Ages**: Set when withdrawals begin from each account to model early retirement scenarios

### Retirement Projections
- **Accumulation Phase**: Project portfolio growth from now until retirement with compound interest and contributions
- **Withdrawal Phase**: Simulate retirement spending with tax-optimized withdrawal strategies
- **Social Security Integration**: Include Social Security benefits starting at your chosen age
- **Inflation Adjustment**: All projections account for inflation over time

### Tax-Optimized Withdrawals
The withdrawal algorithm follows a tax-efficient strategy:
1. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Mandatory withdrawals from traditional accounts starting at age 73
2. **Account Availability**: Respects configured withdrawal start ages (e.g., delaying IRA withdrawals until age 60)
3. **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: Calculates 10% penalty for US traditional account withdrawals before age 59.5
4. **Tax Bracket Optimization**: Fill lower tax brackets with traditional withdrawals
5. **Roth Withdrawals**: Tax-free withdrawals for remaining needs
6. **Taxable Account Withdrawals**: With capital gains tracking
7. **HSA**: Used last, tax-free for qualified medical expenses

## How It Works

### Accumulation Phase
For each year until retirement:
1. Apply investment returns to existing balance
2. Add annual contribution (with employer match if applicable)
3. Grow contribution amount by contribution growth rate

### Withdrawal Phase
For each year of retirement:
1. Calculate Required Minimum Distribution (if age 73+)
2. Determine target spending (safe withdrawal rate + inflation)
3. Subtract Social Security income from spending need
4. Withdraw from accounts in tax-optimized order
5. Apply investment returns to remaining balance
6. Calculate federal and state taxes

### Key Assumptions
- Investment returns are applied annually
- Contributions are made at year-end
- RMDs follow the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
- Social Security benefits grow with inflation
- Tax brackets are 2024 values (not inflation-adjusted)

## Configuration

### Default Values
| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Current Age | 35 |
| Retirement Age | 65 |
| Life Expectancy | 90 |
| Inflation Rate | 3% |
| Safe Withdrawal Rate | 4% |
| Retirement Return Rate | 5% |
| Social Security Benefit | $30,000/year |
| Social Security Start Age | 67 |

### Account Defaults
| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Expected Return | 7% |
| Contribution Growth | 3% |

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all calculations:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Federal and state/provincial tax calculations (US & Canada)
- Capital gains taxation with country-specific rules
- RMD calculations (US) and RRIF minimums (Canada)
- Accumulation phase projections
- Withdrawal phase simulations
- Canadian account type recognition
- Edge cases (zero balances, long retirements, etc.)

**Current test count: 85 tests**
